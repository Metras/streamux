Streamux Developer's Guide to Boostrapping
==========================================

Before you can run the current Streamux code, you need to build a copy
of MPD with a patch to enable seamless icecast playback. The script
build-static-mpd.sh does this for you, by checking out trunk MPD,
applying the patch, and compiling MPD statically.

This means you can then drop the mpd binary on a server, and have full
file decoding and shoutcast streaming, without installing anything
else.

Once the binary is built, make a copy of streamux.conf.dist and
customize it to your local configuration.

With that, you're ready to go. Just run `python2.4 test.py
streamux.conf` to boot the current Streamux code into a test scenario.

Have fun!
